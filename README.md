## Purpose/Objective: 

Whereas the prevalence of lymph node level (LNL) involvement in head&neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has been reported, the details of lymphatic progression patterns are insufficiently quantified. In this study, we investigate how the risk of metastases in each LNL depends on whether upstream LNLs harbour metastases, T-category, HPV status and other risk factors.  


## Materials/Methods:

We retrospectively analysed patients with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal HNSCC treated at a single institution, resulting in a dataset of 287 patients. For all patients, involvement of LNLs I-VII was recorded individually based on available modalities (PET, MR, CT, FNP) together with clinicopathological factors. To analyse the dataset, a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed, which allows querying the number of patients with a certain combination of co-involved LNLs and tumor characteristics.


## Results:

Here, we share this extracted dataset publicly. It can also be explored interactively at [this web interface](https://2021-oropharynx.lyprox.org/).


## Conclusions:

Detailed quantification of LNL involvement in HNSCC depending on involvement of upstream LNLs and clinicopathological factors may allow for further personalization of CTV-N definition in the future.
