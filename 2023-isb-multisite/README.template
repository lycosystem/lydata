## Cohort Characteristics

Below we show some figures that aim to coarsely characterize the patient cohort in this directory.

## Online Interface

We provide a user-friendly and intuitive graphical user interface to view the dataset, which is available at https://lyprox.org/. The GUI has two main functionalities: the patient list and the dashboard. The patient list allows for viewing the characteristics of a patient, corresponding to one row of the csv file, in a visually appealing and intuitive way. The dashboard allows for filtering of the dataset. For example, the user may select all patients with primary tumors extending over the mid-sagittal plane with involvement of ipsilateral level III. The dashboard will then display the number or percentage of patients with metastases in each of the other LNLs.

## Data Description

The data is provided as a CSV-table containing one row for each of the {{ num_patients }} patients. The table has a header with three levels that describe the columns. Below we explain each column in the form of a list with three levels. So, for example, list entry 1.i.g refers to a column with the three-level header `patient | # | nicotine_abuse` and this column reports about the patient's smoking status.
